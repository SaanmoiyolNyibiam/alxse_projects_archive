# Overview

In addition to getting your technical tools set up, there’s another tool that’s critical to your success any area of life: growth mindset. Today, you’ll start to better understand what it is and what it isn’t– and you’ll start to practice using it. First stop is a TED talk by Stanford University professor, Carol Dweck.

# Resources :
- [Angela Duckworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H14bBuluwB8)
- [carol Dweck: Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU&feature=youtu.be)
- [The power of yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLeUvZvuvAs&feature=youtu.be)

# Learning objectives include :
- What is grit?
- What evidence is there that grit is important? (Can you briefly describe one study that Duckworth mentions?) (What groups were examined, what was the treatment they received, and what was the result?)
- What is growth mindset?
- What is fixed mindset?
- How do brains behave when they are in fixed vs. growth mindset?
- What evidence is there that growth mindset is important?
You should be able to describe 1 study at a high level: What was the group that was studied? What was the “treatment” (or variable that the different participants received)? What was the result of that study? (again, high level, no need for small details)
