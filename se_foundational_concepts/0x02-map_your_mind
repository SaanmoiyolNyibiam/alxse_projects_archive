# Map Your Mind

As a Software Engineer, critical thinking is a trait one must have in order to design solutions that
solve problems most efficiently. This project unveils the thought process a Software Engineer should
have and the processes they could take to solve a problem.

## Learning Objectives
- What is a Pseudocode?
- why is Pseudocoding important in programming?
- How do you write Pseudocodes?

## Tasks

### Task 0
Develop an algorithm that calculates the sum of squares of given input of numbers.
You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

- Create the algorithm in a flow chart save a screen shot and upload it to google drive, and give access to anyone with the link
- Create pseudo code in a google doc and and give access to anyone with the link

### Task 1
Develop an algorithm that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order.
You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

- Create the algorithm in a flow chart save a screen shot and upload it to google drive, and give access to anyone with the link
- Create pseudo code in a google doc and and give access to anyone with the link

### Task 2
Develop an algorithm that calculates a running sum.
A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result.
You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

- Create the algorithm in a flow chart save a screen shot and upload it to google drive, and give access to anyone with the link
- Create pseudo code in a google doc and and give access to anyone with the link
