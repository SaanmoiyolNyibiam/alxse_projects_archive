# SE Foundations

The primary focus of Foundations is to achieve mastery of fundamental engineering concepts and become skilled in coding.  
Professional Development will be a key supplement of this primary goal. At the conclusion of Foundations, 
students will have acquired a strong foundation of technical knowledge from which they can either build 
upon with a Specialization or begin preparing for interviews and jobs.
